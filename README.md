A toy JRPG demo written for the NES in 6502 assembly.

###  Scope

This game is a minimal and partial implementation of a 2D JRPG game with:

- top-down view
- simple overworld
- no battles
- bi-directional (but not free-directional) scrolling--the screen can move right, left, up, and down, but not simultaneously
- collisions
- UI state transitions
  - town
  - house
  - scene
  - inventory menu
  - overworld
- NPCs (with ability to walk around)
- dialogue box for interacting with entities like NPCs and letters
- an item to pick up
